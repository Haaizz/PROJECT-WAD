					<h2 class="text-center">ABOUT US</h2>
					<p>The given name is Faiz. I am 19 years old from the northern state of Penang. I have got the idea to establish a system involving stationery.</p>

					<p>Stationery House is a shop inspired by its manager, Muhd Faiz. This stationery shop provides a variety of stationery consisting of pens, pencils, books, and so on. The Stationery System aims to become a stationery shop that is famous all over the world. The design will also build and design a stationery shop themed website and include HTML elements in it. There will also have a section that will make it easier for users to choose the items they need such as a division of books that are comics, lessons, scientific and more . This stationery also not only sells books, but there are also other stationery items such as pencils, pens and paper. The website that will be created will make things easier for customers because they only need to interact at the tip of their fingers. They don't have to come far to the store to get the things they want. They only need to deal online through the website.</p>
